# Hi there, I'm Rehumile! üëãüèΩ
I'm a Software Development student who is passsionate about coding and eager to learn new things. Currently, I'm focusing on gaining exeperience in the frontend Technologies including HTML, CSS, Javscript and ReactJS. I'm excited to see where this path takes me.

As someone who has always had a passion for coding, I chose to puruse it as a career. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems with code and creating applications that make a difference. I'm also constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set.
Some projects I have created include:
- A Order tracking web app called [Kitchen Express](https://github.com/Rehumile/REHSEK080_FTO2301_GroupC_RehumileSekoto_IWA_18.git)
+ A Online book library called [BookConnect](https://github.com/Rehumile/REHSEK080_FTO2301_GroupC_RehumileSekoto_IWA19.git)



When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books that aid in my personal development. I also enjoy the outdoors, taking walks, and watching all kinds of Documentries(true crime mostlyüòÇ )

If you'd like to connect with me, feel free to reach out at **sekotorehumile1@gmail.com**. I look forward to hearing from you and collaborating on exciting projects in the future!
